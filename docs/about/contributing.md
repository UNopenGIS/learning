* Prefix the commit message with one of the following tags:
  * `feat:` A new feature
  * `fix:` A bug fix
  * `docs:` Documentation only changes
  * `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  * `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  * `perf:` A code change that improves performance
  * `test:` Adding missing or correcting existing tests
  * `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
* Try to use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
